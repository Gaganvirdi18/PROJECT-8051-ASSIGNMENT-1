It is introducing the Virtual Pet Simulator, a C# console application that emulates the experience of nurturing a virtual pet. This undertaking introduces fundamental programming principles, including program organization, console input/output, data types, type conversion, and control flow components.

Pet Creation: Enable users to choose a specific type of pet (such as a cat, dog, or rabbit) and assign it a name. Present a welcoming message that includes the pet's type and name.
Actions for Pet Care, such as feeding, playing, and allowing the pet to relax, all impact its statistics. Display notifications that explain the consequences of each action.
Monitoring Your Pet's Status: Track and display the pet's statistics, including hunger, happiness, and health, on a scale from 1 to 10. Implement a status check to inform the user when these stats are dangerously low or high.
Time-Based Changes Simulate the passage of time, with each action representing an hour. Hunger increases over time, while contentment gradually decreases, necessitating regular interaction.

Interaction Logic: Introduce consequences for negligence, such as potential health problems when the pet is extremely hungry or unhappy. Incorporate tailored messages or events based on the pet's condition (for example, the pet refusing to play if it is hungry). User Interface and Experience: Develop a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly terminal interface. Include clear instructions on how to navigate the program. How to Use: Launch the application. Choose a pet type (1 for cat, 2 for dog, 3 for rabbit) and assign a name. To interact with your virtual pet, follow the prompts on the screen. Feed, play, rest, check status, and exit the simulator through the main menuâ€”requirements: .NET Core SDK.
